{"access network": "is a network which is connected to the first router along the path that connects any destination end system with the source one. ", "application layer": "it's the layer of the network where network applications do exchange messages (packets in the application layer) between different end-system, ruled with protocols like ftp, smtp, http and dns.", "link layer": "it's the net layer which manage the data transfer between neighboring network elements. here packets are referred as frames.", "network edge": "they are the terminal part of the network. we call them hosts, which are divided between clients and servers. the formers are any electronic device connected to the internet (like personal pcs, laptops, tablets, smartphones, ...) utilized by a final user, the latters are powerful machines that store and manage web pages, databases, ...", "network layer": "it's the network layer meant to route the datagrams (net-layer packet) through routing protocols. it also includes the ip protocol, which is a protocol responsible for the assignment of the ip address (a number which uniquely identifies a machine) for every host that connects to internet.
